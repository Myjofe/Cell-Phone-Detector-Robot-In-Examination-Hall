# Cell-Phone-Detector-Robot-In-Examination-Hall
There is a strong need to restrict mobile phone use in specific locations and at specific times. This project focuses on developing a system that would detect the existence of GSM signals from an illegal user in restricted locations such as examination halls, hospitals, and essential meeting places. To address this issue, I am going to develop an automated detection of cell phones. Keeping in mind that this project primarily focuses on creating a cell phone detecting robot, namely in examination halls where students abuse mobile phones by making concealed calls, internet access, data transfer, SMS, incoming and outgoing calls, and so on. The detector, which may be set at the entry or within an Examination-Hall, will be able to move within an Examination-Hall by following the line as it passes. When the detector detects signal from an active  cell phone or airplane or off mobile phone, the LED blinks, information is displayed on the LCD, and an real time notification is sent via GSM to the registered mobile number programmed in the microcontroller to notify the supervisor the presence of a mobile phone.
